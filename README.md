# web-scraper-timesjobs.com
This simple web scraper uses beautifulsoup 4 to scrape the job posts website timesjobs.com. 

The program asks for the city where to look for jobs, then saves a CSV file in the same folder listing:
- Job Position
- Company Name
- Link to the post
- When it was posted

This program only scrapes the first listing page.
